In the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction project, the focus was on leveraging machine learning techniques to develop an accurate model for identifying individuals at risk of developing CKD. The project involved collecting and preprocessing a diverse set of medical data, encompassing patient demographics, clinical test results, and lifestyle factors. Through careful exploratory data analysis (EDA), relevant features were selected, and missing values were handled appropriately. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, were trained. The resulting model demonstrated a commendable predictive performance, effectively distinguishing individuals with potential CKD. The project's ultimate goal was to provide a reliable tool for early detection and intervention, aiding healthcare professionals in mitigating the impact of CKD through proactive patient care and management strategies.
